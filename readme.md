# Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project involves building a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify images of digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing images, and splitting data.
- **Neural Network**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras with layers including Dense
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy and loss are used to evaluate performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots for accuracy and loss, as well as sample predictions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
